Your team is tasked with analyzing a newly released dataset: the Global Earthquake-Tsunami Risk Assessment Dataset, which contains seismic and tsunami-related data from 782 significant earthquakes worldwide between 2001 and 2022.\n\nYour supervisor has asked you to process and analyze this dataset using the R programming to generate insights that can inform economic policy, infrastructure investment, and early warning systems.\n\n## Dataset Description\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Variable metadata and tsunami relevance\n\n|Feature   |Type    |Description                                   |Range / Values      |Tsunami relevance                    |\n|:---------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------------|:------------------------------------|\n|magnitude |Float   |Earthquake magnitude (Richter scale)          |6.5 - 9.1           |High — Primary tsunami predictor     |\n|cdi       |Integer |Community Decimal Intensity (felt intensity)  |0 - 9               |Medium — Population impact measure   |\n|mmi       |Integer |Modified Mercalli Intensity (instrumental)    |1 - 9               |Medium — Structural damage indicator |\n|sig       |Integer |Event significance score                      |650 - 2910          |High — Overall hazard assessment     |\n|nst       |Integer |Number of seismic monitoring stations         |0 - 934             |Low — Data quality indicator         |\n|dmin      |Float   |Distance to nearest seismic station (degrees) |0.0 - 17.7          |Low — Location precision             |\n|gap       |Float   |Azimuthal gap between stations (degrees)      |0.0 - 239.0         |Low — Location reliability           |\n|depth     |Float   |Earthquake focal depth (km)                   |2.7 - 670.8         |High — Shallow = higher tsunami risk |\n|latitude  |Float   |Epicenter latitude (WGS84)                    |−61.85° to 71.63°   |High — Ocean proximity indicator     |\n|longitude |Float   |Epicenter longitude (WGS84)                   |−179.97° to 179.66° |High — Ocean proximity indicator     |\n|Year      |Integer |Year of occurrence                            |2001 - 2022         |Medium — Temporal patterns           |\n|Month     |Integer |Month of occurrence                           |1 - 12              |Low — Seasonal analysis              |\n|tsunami   |Binary  |Tsunami potential (TARGET)                    |0, 1                |Target variable                      |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Your mission: complete the following tasks:\n\nUse `R` and `ggplot2` to complete each task. Submit your code and visual outputs with brief explanations.\n\n1.  **Load and inspect the Dataset**\n    -   Load the CSV file into R.\n    -   Use `str()`, `summary()`, and `head()` to inspect the structure and contents.\n    -   Identify the number of tsunami vs. non-tsunami events.\n2.  **Earthquake magnitude distribution**\n    -   Create a histogram of earthquake magnitudes using `ggplot2`\n    -   Add appropriate axis labels and title.\n    -   Briefly describe the distribution.\n3.  **Tsunami event proportion**\n    -   Create a bar chart showing the count of tsunami vs. non-tsunami events.\n    -   Use `ggplot2` and customize colors.\n    -   What percentage of events are tsunami-related?\n4.  **Earthquake frequency by year**\n    -   Create a line plot showing the number of earthquakes per year.\n    -   Use `geom_line()` or `geom_col()` with year as the x-axis\n    -   Identify any years with spikes in activity.\n5.  **Latitude vs. longitude plot**\n    -   Create a scatter plot of earthquake epicenters using latitude and longitude.\n    -   Color-code points by tsunami potential (0 or 1).\n    -   What regions appear most tsunami-prone?\n6.  **Depth vs. magnitude**\n    -   Create a scatter plot of earthquake depth vs. magnitude\n    -   Use color or shape to distinguish tsunami events.\n    -   Discuss any patterns you observe.\n7.  **Intensity comparison**\n    -   Use boxplots to compare cdi (Community Decimal Intensity) between tsunami and non-tsunami events.\n    -   What does this suggest about population impact?\n8.  **Annotated insight**\n    -   Choose one plot and add annotations using `geom_text()` or `geom_label()` to highlight key insights.\n    -   Explain why this insight matters for economic planning.\n9.  **Save your visuals**\n    -   Save at least three plots as PNG files using `ggsave()`.\n    -   Include filenames and dimensions in your code.\n10. **Reflection**\n    -   Write a short reflection (150–200 words) on how data visualization can support disaster resilience and economic decision-making.\n\n## Midterm files and submission:\n\n1. Access the midterm R script and dataset from this link: [Midterm Project Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xhs3hcCCBiOaKT59_t1KYi4767O_Db5Q?usp=sharing)\n\n2. Submission link will be provided 5 days before the deadline.\n\n3. Deadline: **November 3, 2025, 11:59 PM PST**",
