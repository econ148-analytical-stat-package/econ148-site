## Scenario: Interning at the Global Risk Observatory (GRO)

You’ve just landed a midterm internship at the Global Risk Observatory (GRO), an international think tank that advises governments and humanitarian agencies on disaster preparedness and economic resilience. Your team is tasked with analyzing a newly released dataset: the Global Earthquake-Tsunami Risk Assessment Dataset, which contains seismic and tsunami-related data from 782 significant earthquakes worldwide between 2001 and 2022.

Your supervisor has asked you to process and analyze this dataset using the R programming to generate insights that can inform economic policy, infrastructure investment, and early warning systems.

## Your mission: Complete the following tasks:

Use `R` and `ggplot2` to complete each task. Submit your code and visual outputs with brief explanations.

1.  **Load and Inspect the Dataset**
    -   Load the CSV file into R.
    -   Use `str()`, `summary()`, and `head()` to inspect the structure and contents.
    -   Identify the number of tsunami vs. non-tsunami events.
2.  **Earthquake Magnitude Distribution**
    -   Create a histogram of earthquake magnitudes using `ggplot2`
    -   Add appropriate axis labels and title.
    -   Briefly describe the distribution.
3.  **Tsunami Event Proportion**
    -   Create a bar chart showing the count of tsunami vs. non-tsunami events.
    -   Use `ggplot2` and customize colors.
    -   What percentage of events are tsunami-related?
4.  **Earthquake Frequency by Year**
    -   Create a line plot showing the number of earthquakes per year.
    -   Use `geom_line()` or `geom_col()` with year as the x-axis
    -   Identify any years with spikes in activity.
5.  **Latitude vs. Longitude Plot**
    -   Create a scatter plot of earthquake epicenters using latitude and longitude.
    -   Color-code points by tsunami potential (0 or 1).
    -   What regions appear most tsunami-prone?
6.  **Depth vs. Magnitude**
    -   Create a scatter plot of earthquake depth vs. magnitude
    -   Use color or shape to distinguish tsunami events.
    -   Discuss any patterns you observe.
7.  **Intensity Comparison**
    -   Use boxplots to compare cdi (Community Decimal Intensity) between tsunami and non-tsunami events.
    -   What does this suggest about population impact?
8.  **Annotated Insight**
    -   Choose one plot and add annotations using `geom_text()` or `geom_label()` to highlight key insights.
    -   Explain why this insight matters for economic planning.
9.  **Save Your Visuals**
    -   Save at least three plots as PNG files using `ggsave()`.
    -   Include filenames and dimensions in your code.
10. **Reflection**
    -   Write a short reflection (150–200 words) on how data visualization can support disaster resilience and economic decision-making.
