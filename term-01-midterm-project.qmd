## Scenario: Interning at the Global Risk Observatory (GRO)

You’ve just landed a midterm internship at the Global Risk Observatory (GRO), an international think tank that advises governments and humanitarian agencies on disaster preparedness and economic resilience. Your team is tasked with analyzing a newly released dataset: the Global Earthquake-Tsunami Risk Assessment Dataset, which contains seismic and tsunami-related data from 782 significant earthquakes worldwide between 2001 and 2022.

Your supervisor has asked you to process and analyze this dataset using the R programming to generate insights that can inform economic policy, infrastructure investment, and early warning systems.

## Dataset Description

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tibble)
library(knitr)

var_meta <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Feature, ~Type, ~Description, ~`Range / Values`, ~`Tsunami relevance`,
  "magnitude", "Float", "Earthquake magnitude (Richter scale)", "6.5 - 9.1", "High — Primary tsunami predictor",
  "cdi", "Integer", "Community Decimal Intensity (felt intensity)", "0 - 9", "Medium — Population impact measure",
  "mmi", "Integer", "Modified Mercalli Intensity (instrumental)", "1 - 9", "Medium — Structural damage indicator",
  "sig", "Integer", "Event significance score", "650 - 2910", "High — Overall hazard assessment",
  "nst", "Integer", "Number of seismic monitoring stations", "0 - 934", "Low — Data quality indicator",
  "dmin", "Float", "Distance to nearest seismic station (degrees)", "0.0 - 17.7", "Low — Location precision",
  "gap", "Float", "Azimuthal gap between stations (degrees)", "0.0 - 239.0", "Low — Location reliability",
  "depth", "Float", "Earthquake focal depth (km)", "2.7 - 670.8", "High — Shallow = higher tsunami risk",
  "latitude", "Float", "Epicenter latitude (WGS84)", "−61.85° to 71.63°", "High — Ocean proximity indicator",
  "longitude", "Float", "Epicenter longitude (WGS84)", "−179.97° to 179.66°", "High — Ocean proximity indicator",
  "Year", "Integer", "Year of occurrence", "2001 - 2022", "Medium — Temporal patterns",
  "Month", "Integer", "Month of occurrence", "1 - 12", "Low — Seasonal analysis",
  "tsunami", "Binary", "Tsunami potential (TARGET)", "0, 1", "Target variable"
)

knitr::kable(var_meta, caption = "Variable metadata and tsunami relevance")

```

## Your mission: complete the following tasks:

Use `R` and `ggplot2` to complete each task. Submit your code and visual outputs with brief explanations.

1.  **Load and inspect the Dataset**
    -   Load the CSV file into R.
    -   Use `str()`, `summary()`, and `head()` to inspect the structure and contents.
    -   Identify the number of tsunami vs. non-tsunami events.
2.  **Earthquake magnitude distribution**
    -   Create a histogram of earthquake magnitudes using `ggplot2`
    -   Add appropriate axis labels and title.
    -   Briefly describe the distribution.
3.  **Tsunami event proportion**
    -   Create a bar chart showing the count of tsunami vs. non-tsunami events.
    -   Use `ggplot2` and customize colors.
    -   What percentage of events are tsunami-related?
4.  **Earthquake frequency by year**
    -   Create a line plot showing the number of earthquakes per year.
    -   Use `geom_line()` or `geom_col()` with year as the x-axis
    -   Identify any years with spikes in activity.
5.  **Latitude vs. longitude plot**
    -   Create a scatter plot of earthquake epicenters using latitude and longitude.
    -   Color-code points by tsunami potential (0 or 1).
    -   What regions appear most tsunami-prone?
6.  **Depth vs. magnitude**
    -   Create a scatter plot of earthquake depth vs. magnitude
    -   Use color or shape to distinguish tsunami events.
    -   Discuss any patterns you observe.
7.  **Intensity comparison**
    -   Use boxplots to compare cdi (Community Decimal Intensity) between tsunami and non-tsunami events.
    -   What does this suggest about population impact?
8.  **Annotated insight**
    -   Choose one plot and add annotations using `geom_text()` or `geom_label()` to highlight key insights.
    -   Explain why this insight matters for economic planning.
9.  **Save your visuals**
    -   Save at least three plots as PNG files using `ggsave()`.
    -   Include filenames and dimensions in your code.
10. **Reflection**
    -   Write a short reflection (150–200 words) on how data visualization can support disaster resilience and economic decision-making.
