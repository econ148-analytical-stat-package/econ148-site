**Course title**: Econ148: Analytical and statistical packages for economics 1 <br> **Instructor**: Christopher Llones <br> **Assignment**: E-commerce sales dataset analysis in R <br> **Due Date**: 15 October 2025


## Objective

This assignment will strengthen your ability to analyze economic data using R. You’ll work with a synthetic but realistic dataset of e-commerce transactions from 2024–2025. Your goal is to apply `dplyr` and other relevant packages to explore sales patterns, profit margins, and regional trends.


## Instructions

- Use R and the `dplyr` package to answer each question.

- Submit your R script file (.R) with your code and outputs.

- Use the pipe operator (`%>%`) for all data manipulations.

- You may use additional packages like `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, or `stringr` if needed.

- Ensure your code is clean, commented, and reproducible.

## Questions

**Part 1: Data familiarization**

1. How many rows and columns are in the dataset?

2. List all unique product categories and sub-categories.

3. What are the earliest and latest order dates?

**Part 2: sales and profit analysis**

4. What is the total sales and total profit across all transactions?

5. Which region generated the highest total profit?

6. What is the average discount applied across all orders?

**Part 3: produce performance**

7. Which product had the highest total sales?

8. Which sub-category had the lowest average profit per unit sold?

9. Identify the top 5 cities by total sales.

**Part 4: time series and trend analysis**

10. Group the data by month and summarize total sales and profit.

11. Which month had the highest sales volume?

12. Plot a time series of monthly sales using ggplot2.


**Bonus Challenge**

13. Create a new column for profit margin (profit as a percentage of sales). Then, find the average profit margin by region.

14. Identify any product with a negative profit margin and explain possible reasons.



## Grading rubrics

| Criteria | Excellent (5pts) | Good (4pts) | Fair (2-3 pts) | Needs improvement (0-1 pt) |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Code accuracy** | All answers are correct and match expected outputs. | Most answers are correct with minor errors. | Several answers are incorrect or incomplete. | Many answers are missing or incorrect. |
| **Use of** `dplyr` **Functions** | Consistently uses appropriate `dplyr` verbs (`filter`, `mutate`, `summarise`, etc.). | Uses `dplyr` functions correctly in most cases. | Uses some `dplyr` functions but inconsistently or incorrectly. | Rarely uses `dplyr` or misuses functions. |
| **Pipe Operator Usage (**`%>%`**)** | Pipe operator is used fluently and correctly throughout. | Mostly correct usage with occasional syntax issues. | Used sporadically or with frequent errors. | Not used or used incorrectly. |
| **Data Manipulation & Filtering** | Demonstrates strong understanding of filtering, grouping, and summarizing. | Shows good grasp with minor gaps. | Basic filtering and grouping attempted but lacks depth. | Little to no meaningful data manipulation. |
| **Insight & Interpretation** | Provides thoughtful insights or observations where applicable. | Some interpretation is present. | Minimal interpretation or unclear reasoning. | No interpretation or irrelevant commentary. |
| **Bonus Challenge (Q13–Q14)** | Completed with correct logic and creative approach. | Attempted with mostly correct logic. | Attempted but contains errors or lacks clarity. | Not attempted or incorrect. |
| **Reproducibility** | Code runs without errors and produces expected results. | Minor issues but generally reproducible. | Some errors prevent full reproducibility. | Code fails to run or produces major errors. |
